## Collections

Collections are easy to use.

Mistakes are easy to avoid when you read the documentation along with using the code.

For an example, LinkedList:
Implements Serializable, Cloneable, Iterable, Collection, Deque, List, Queue
- Cloneable - you can clone it
- Serializable - you can compress the data?
- Iterable - can iterate over it
- Collection - acts like a collection, has methods of collection
- Deque - a double ended queue, allows you to take things off both ends

Set - there are 3 main types of sets
- TreeSet
- HashSet
- LinkedHashSet

Yes, this number justifies it being an interface. These different types all 
have similar functions.

For the example of LinkedList:
LinkedLists extend several superclasses (a total of 4 levels):
- AbstractSequentialList - ordered
- AbstractList - not ordered
- AbstractCollection - has iterators and size methods
- Object - everything is an object
